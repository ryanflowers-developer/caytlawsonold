                    <p>Cayt Lawson obtained a degree in Liberal Studies and aspires to further her college education in the future, purely for the enjoyment of learning. She quite possibly would have made a career as a student; alas, the financial carnage that would’ve wrecked, made that a less than viable option.</p>
                    <p>Writing was always instinctual for her; a personal enjoyment she partook in regularly since childhood. But it had never before occurred to her to pursue a career in writing until her husband gave her a less than subtle shove towards publishing her personal works.</p>
                    <p>Cayt credits her adventurous childhood for her character and story inspirations. Raised in the country, surrounded by family, she enjoyed a safe, lovely childhood where she was able to run barefoot in the sunshine and use her imagination to her heart's content.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, her family didn’t have a lot of money, but they were rich in grandma’s cookie dough and fields under spacious skies. She had a delightful childhood spent riding horses, feeding piglets, hopping round bales of hay, crossing muddied creeks and running from deranged chickens. -Oh, the farm poultry horrors!</p>
                    <p>She has always had a passion for writing and storytelling. Her earliest memories include inventing plots and characters; many of which her three younger siblings were often the unfortunate recipients of such designated roles. Cayt admits to being slightly dictating over their child’s play, but only slightly, as is an elder sister’s prerogative.</p>
                    <p>Cayt currently spends most of her time trying to keep up with her three energetic, young, children and -much to the detriment of her husband’s sanity- adding animals to her growing hobby farm. When Cayt isn’t reading or caring for her beloved children and critters, her time is spent researching and thinking up new stories.</p>
                    <p>She hopes readers will enjoy her characters and their stories as much as she has enjoyed writing them. </p>
