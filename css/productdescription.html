<br><br><br>
Lady Ann Dunneroy finds herself in a desperate situation and her search for the man responsible leads her on a perilous journey to the American West. Relying solely on her wit and resourcefulness to survive, she strikes a deal with a rugged mountain man by the name of Grayson Stone. The more time Ann spends with Grayson, the less certain she is of the original mission she embarked upon.
<br><br>
Determined to do what is right, Ann must make a difficult decision; one that may break her heart and perhaps cost her very life as well as the lives of those she loves most…
<br><br>
Grayson Stone is the leader of the wagon train and it’s his job to ensure everyone arrives safely; a duty made aggravatingly more challenging when he agrees to escort a reckless, young woman along the way. A hard man, as rugged and imposing as the mountains he calls home, Grayson wants only to live a peaceful life of solitude. 
<br><br>
But something about the tenacious Lady Ann makes him yearn for more…

<b><em>Excerpt from Ann’s Valley:</em></b>
<br><br>
“Nothing has changed.” Grayson’s words were direct and curt. 
<br>
Ann stiffened, feeling her anger with him return, “I hadn’t been under the impression they had.”
<br>
“Do not confront me again on the matter. I will not change my mind. No woman or child allowed on the trail unless accompanied by a guardian. Is that understood?”
<br>
“Perfectly.” She leveled him with her most imperious stare. Then added impertinently, “And do you own the trail, then?”
<br>
His jaw clenched in irritable fashion, fastening her with a menacing glower, “Don’t even think about following on your own.”
<br>
“You can’t stop me.”
